A Theos tweak that rebuilds Spotify for iOS in Liquid Glass. One dylib injected into a decrypted
IPA, signed with your own certificate, no jailbreak. Every piece has a switch in Settings → Mod
Settings.

- [x] AMOLED black, Home gradient
- [x] Ad blocking
- [x] Spoof Premium
- [x] Tracker blocking
- [x] Custom tab bar
- [x] Double tap zones on the player
- [x] Like and dislike on the lock screen
- [x] Hide anything
- [x] Every flag Spotify ships
- [ ] Custom lyrics
- [ ] Block an artist
- [ ] Radio stations from a stream URL
- [ ] Alternate app icons
- [ ] Open on the tab you choose
- [ ] Long press and swipe gestures

## Get it

No IPA is distributed here. [spoti.pw](https://spoti.pw) carries the current build and doubles as a
source for SideStore, AltStore and Feather: add `https://spoti.pw` and later builds arrive on their
own.

The app keeps Spotify's bundle id, so it installs over the real Spotify. Sign it under a mismatched
App ID and it still installs, but the lock screen card opens nothing.

### Signing it yourself

In Feather, set **Identifier** to the App ID in its certificates tab and leave **PPQ protection**
off. AltStore, SideStore and Sideloadly work this out themselves.

A build the lock screen cannot open says so on first launch and names the bundle id to sign under.

## Build it yourself

Bring a decrypted Spotify IPA. The result is an unsigned `Spotify-<version>-glass.ipa`, to sign with
SideStore, Feather or any certificate signer.

### On GitHub, no Mac needed

Fork the repo, enable Actions, run the **Build IPA from your own Spotify IPA** workflow. It takes a
direct link to your decrypted `.ipa` and hands the built IPA back as a workflow artifact. The link is
masked in the log and the result stays in your fork.

### On a Mac

Theos in `~/theos` with an iPhoneOS SDK in `~/theos/sdks`, plus:

    brew install make ldid dpkg zsign ideviceinstaller libimobiledevice
    uv tool install "cyan @ git+https://github.com/asdfzxcvbn/pyzule-rw"

Put the decrypted `.ipa` in `ipa/`, then:

    make release    # out/Spotify-<version>-glass.ipa, ready to sign
    make install    # the same, signed with your certificate and pushed to the iPhone over USB

`make install` reads `SIGN_P12`, `SIGN_PROFILE` and `SIGN_P12_PASSWORD` from `.signing.env`; copy
`.signing.env.example` and fill it in. It signs under your profile's App ID, which is what keeps the
lock screen player working.

The first build spends a minute reading Spotify's flags out of your IPA, so the flag list matches the
Spotify you built from. `make flags` regenerates it.
